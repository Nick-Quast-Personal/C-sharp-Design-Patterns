# C# Design Patterns

This repository contains implementations of various Design Patterns in TypeScript/JavaScript.

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide proven, tested development paradigms that can help speed up the development process and improve code quality.

## Patterns Included

- **[Observer Design Pattern](./Observer%20Design%20Pattern/)** - Demonstrates the Observer pattern with a trucking company example. Includes both JavaScript and TypeScript implementations.
- **Strategy Design Pattern** (coming soon)
- **Factory Design Pattern** (coming soon)

## How to Run

Each folder is self-contained with its own files and dependencies.

### Observer Design Pattern

```bash
cd "Observer Design Pattern"
node index.js        # Run the JavaScript version
# or
npx ts-node index.ts # Run the TypeScript version (requires ts-node)
```
